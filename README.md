# Ecommerce_back_end

## Description

Eccomerce_back_end is a node app designed to route all CRUD functions for an ecommerce website.


My motivation for this project was to fin ways to easily execute all CRUD functions using express routes for an ecommerce website.
In this project some of the problems I solved were:
- Using modular code to set up routes through many directories
- Use insomnia to test routes
- Use sequelize to database better


## Installation

This being a node.js app, you must first make sure your terminal can run this app by aquiring the needed
packages. You will need npm installed, you can read more about that [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm). You will also need Inquirer installed
which you can find [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). You will then need mysql2 found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2). 
Finally, you will need console.table found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table). Once those dependencies are fitted, you're ready to begin usage.

## Usage

To begin, open your terminal within the root directory, or if you're using VS code, open an integrated terminal.
You then type "node index" on the command line to begin.
